# My Discord bot for my server

# My Discord server
- I am not that active on it, but I use it for bot testing purposes at the moment.
- https://discord.gg/hBbx8MbGfA

# Code
- I took the template from the bot from another person (my handlers were acting up).
- The music control works on 'discord-player'. Since that was acting up and throwing more errors than hours I sleep, I looked at the come from some boys on the showcase [https://discord-player.js.org/showcase].
